# Pytorch_vs_Tensorflow

This repository is a step-by-step introduction to ML/DL using Pytorch, TensorFlow and even customizing ML/DL with fundamental packages like NumPy.

<b>Pytorch</b> is dynamic computation graph and OOP approaches, while <b>Tensorflow</b> is static computation graph. They have different pros and cons, so studying both is a good practice.
